    "\n",
    "- **Dementia:** approximately 368 samples\n",
    "- **ALS:** approximately 368 samples\n",
    "- **Obsessive Compulsive Disorder:** approximately 358 samples\n",
    "- **Scoliosis:** approximately 335 samples\n",
    "- **Parkinsonâ€™s Disease:** approximately 330 samples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Balanced Classes:** The relatively even number of examples per label implies that the training process is less likely to be biased toward any one class.\n",
    "- **Reliable Metrics:** Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and PR-AUC will more reliably reflect model performance because class imbalance issues are minimized.\n",
    "- **Generalization:** With similar representation, the model is more likely to learn discriminative features across classes, leading to better generalization on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the balanced label distribution is a positive indicator for the multi-class classification task."
